>a **web browser** is computer program desplaying web pages and websites.The major function of a browser is to

>present the resource you choose by requesting it from a server and displaying it on the browsers window.The resourse may be 

>anything e.g _images, pdfs, videos_. Any type content requested is displayed if it is available on any of the servers.

>Inorder to view a web page or a web site, the link is typed in or clicked on and then the **enter** button is pressed or the **go** button on the browser,after the page is loaded the browser displays the content which in most cases is located far from the computer. This occurs because the web browser program sends a request to a web _server_ program running on the remote computer which is also called a _Server_ and runs a program called a _server_.

>The _server_ program collects the requests from the browser and looks for the web pages and then it responds.The type of responds

>depends on whether the _server_ program was able to find the content. The communication between the _server_ and _browser_ continues untill all the files have transferred to the browser and once all tansfer is complete the communication is terminated(http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/basics/how_do_web_browser_work.php).

>The information over the web is sent using a set of rules called the **HyperText Transfer 

>Protocol(HTTP)**.It provides a set of instructions for accurate information exchange between the 

**client** and the **server**(http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/basics/http_protocol.php3).
